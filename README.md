# NFT Viewer

NFT Viewer is a simple website to practise my UI skils. 

It is based on a FrontEndMentor challenge (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U), in which I am provided all the asset files and colours that are used in the project. My goal is to recreate this as close as possible to the original image. 

I chose to make this project in React in order to test my skills using components and styled-components to achieve the look.

## Skills used
- Flexbox
- React
- React styled-components
