# NFT Viewer

NFT Viewer is a simple website to practise my UI skils. 

It is based on a FrontEndMentor challenge (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U), in which I am provided all the asset files and colours that are used in the project. My goal is to recreate this as close as possible to the original image.
